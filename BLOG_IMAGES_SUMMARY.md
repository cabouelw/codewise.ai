## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to upgrade to real images later:

1. **Replace with photos/illustrations**:

   - Use design tools like Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
   - Or hire a designer on Fiverr/Upwork
   - Or use AI image generators like Midjourney, DALL-E

2. **Optimize for web**:

   - Export as WebP format (best compression)
   - Or use optimized JPG (80-85% quality)
   - Keep file size under 200KB

3. **Update frontmatter**:
   - Change `.svg` to `.jpg` or `.webp`
   - Images will automatically update
